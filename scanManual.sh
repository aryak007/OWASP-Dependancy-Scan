emailBody="Hi,<br><br>As part of our effort to make software development and delivery processes at par with the recommended security standards, we are implementing recommendations based on OWASP ASVS guidelines. One of the requirements [<a href = "http://owasp-aasvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/requirement-1.1.html">OWASP ASVS v1.1</a>] of the guideline is to ensure that we understand and regularly keep a track of components in our codebase.<br><br>According to OWASP v1.1, all application components must be identified and must be known to be needed.<br><br>To ensure the above, we have implemented checks to filter out/block libraries which do not abide by the above mentioned guidelines. The impacts of this restriction are:<br>1. Any 3rd party or in-house library is not allowed to be checked in along with your code.<br>2. If any such library is already checked in, a periodic scan will detect and send a mail with the names of the libraries.<br><br>.If you are getting this mail, itâ€™s likely that one or more of libraries/files/other components in your codebase are impacted for your repository <a href=$3>$1</a>. These files are listed below:<br><br>"
