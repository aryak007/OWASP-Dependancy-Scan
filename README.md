# OWASP-Dependancy-Scan
This repo scans the source code of repositories  and checks whether any dependancy or binary is checked in or not

## USAGE 
If you want to add a new project to the list of scanned projects, just update the  [`config.json`](https://github.com/aryak93/OWASP-Dependancy-Scan/blob/master/config.json) file with the details of the new project. 

The details include `name` and `link` of the project. The link must be provided with `https` protocol and not `git` protocol. After making the changes, send us a PULL REQUEST. We will review it and accept it.
